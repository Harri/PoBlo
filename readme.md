# PoBlo

PoBlo is a thingy that powers [edarit.fi](https://edarit.fi). Edarit.fi lists latest blog posts from members of parliament of Finland and political parties.

PoBlo does not use any frameworks and only 3rd party library in use is [mustache.php](https://github.com/bobthecow/mustache.php) for templates.
